# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new quote to the hardcoded quotes list in the backend.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the quote "If you wait faster, are you technically arriving sooner?" to the quotes array in `backend/main.mo`'s `getQuotes` query.

**User-visible outcome:** The new quote appears alongside all existing quotes when the application fetches quotes from the backend.
