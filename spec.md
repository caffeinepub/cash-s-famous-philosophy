# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a browsable quote collection app for "Cash's Famous Philosophy" with a bold, absurdist late-night-diner visual theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Backend: Store a collection of philosophy quotes, seeded with at least two example quotes ("If an orange is called an orange, why is an apple not called a red?" and "Your tongue knows what everything tastes like."); expose a query to return all quotes with stable persistence across upgrades.
- Frontend: Fetch and display all quotes from the backend, each presented as its own card in a scrollable layout.
- Frontend: Apply a warm earthy theme (amber, cream, deep brown) with bold serif/slab typography, hand-drawn-style accents, and a slightly chaotic, charming layout that matches the humorous, absurdist tone of the quotes.
- Frontend: Display the philosophy-banner image prominently at the top of the page.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can visit the app and scroll through Cash's philosophy quotes, each displayed on its own styled card, wrapped in a bold, irreverent diner-meets-manifesto visual design.
