  "summary": "The diff only modifies `project_state.json`, which is a metadata/tracking file. No changes were made to `backend/main.mo`. REQ-5 requires auditing and updating `backend/main.mo` to ensure all five quotes are hardcoded in `getQuotes` with no duplicate definitions — none of this was implemented.",

Verify no stale or duplicate definitions exist.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no changes to `backend/main.mo`. The only modified file is `project_state.json`, which is a tracking/metadata file and does not fulfill the requirement to update the backend actor code.",
