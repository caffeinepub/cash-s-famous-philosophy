  "summary": "The diff implements all three core requirements reasonably well. REQ-1 is implemented with both seed quotes and a getQuotes() query function in backend/main.mo, though data persistence across upgrades relies on a MixinStorage mixin that is referenced but not shown. REQ-2 is implemented with QuoteCard components, a responsive grid layout, and quotes fetched from the backend. REQ-3 is implemented with warm earthy tones, Zilla Slab/Caveat fonts, wobble animations, and consistent theming. One concern is that the backend uses a plain immutable array rather than stable storage for persistence, but the MixinStorage mixin may handle this. The required banner image is referenced in the frontend but not included in the diff.",
