  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 are fully implemented. The useGetQuotes hook now has retry:3 and exponential backoff retryDelay, and QuotesPage.tsx shows the skeleton during retries (isPending || isFetching) and only shows the error UI after all retries are exhausted (isError && !isFetching). A manual 'Try again' button was added to the error UI, which is outside the stated non-goals.",

      "reason": "The build request explicitly states 'Adding a manual retry button for users' as a non-goal, yet a RefreshCw button calling refetch() was added to the error screen.",
